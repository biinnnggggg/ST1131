# Housing Prices Prediction using Linear Regression
This repository contains the source code and report for the project conducted in ST1131 - Introduction to Statistics and Statistical Computing, where we applied linear regression to predict housing prices in Singapore.

## Project Overview
In this project, we aimed to predict housing prices in Singapore using a linear regression model. The project involved collecting and analyzing housing price data, followed by building and evaluating a predictive model. The dataset was processed and analyzed using R for statistical computing.

## Objective

1. The goal of this project was to:
2. Understand the relationship between housing prices and various features (e.g., number of rooms, location, etc.)
3. Build a linear regression model to predict housing prices
4. Evaluate the performance of the model using statistical metrics

## Data Analysis Process
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
    - Descriptive statistics and visualizations (e.g., histograms, scatter plots) were created to understand the distribution of data and the relationships between features and housing prices.
    - Correlation analysis was performed to identify which features had the strongest relationship with housing prices.
2. Model Building:
    - We applied linear regression to model the relationship between the features and the housing price.
    - The model was trained using a training dataset, and various evaluation metrics (R-squared, Mean Absolute Error) were used to assess its performance.
3. Model Evaluation:
    - We validated the model using a test dataset and assessed the accuracy of the predictions.
    - The results were visualized through residual plots to evaluate the model's fit.
4. Conclusion:
    - The final modelâ€™s performance was summarized, and the most significant features influencing housing prices were identified.
